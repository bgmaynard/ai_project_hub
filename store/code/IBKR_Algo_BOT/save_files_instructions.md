# 📥 How to Save Your Training Files

## The files are in the artifacts panel (left side of your screen)

You should see these artifacts already created:

1. ⭐ **train_real_stocks_MTF_FIXED.py** - Main training script
2. **check_data_settings.py** - Diagnostic (you already have this working!)
3. **compare_before_after_mtf.py** - Results comparison
4. **MTF_IMPLEMENTATION_GUIDE.md** - Complete guide

---

## 🔧 Quick Fix - Save Method 1 (Copy/Paste)

Since the artifacts are incomplete (they were too long), let me give you the complete files to copy:

### Save as: `train_real_stocks_MTF_FIXED.py`

Click "Copy" below and paste into a new file:

```python
# I'll provide the complete code in the next message
# This file is about 400 lines
```

## 💡 Alternative - Let Me Create Smaller, Focused Version

Since the full training script is long, let me create a **simpler version** that focuses on just fixing your current training script.

**Option A:** Patch your existing file (quick, 2 minutes)
**Option B:** Use complete new file (more features, 5 minutes to save)

Which would you prefer?

## 🎯 Quickest Solution (Recommended)

Let me create a **patch script** that fixes your existing `train_real_stocks.py` file automatically!

This will:
1. Read your current file
2. Fix the data settings
3. Add MTF features
4. Save as new file

**Ready in next message!**

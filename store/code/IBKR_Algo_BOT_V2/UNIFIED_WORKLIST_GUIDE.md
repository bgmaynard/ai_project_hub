# 📋 Unified WORKLIST System

## The Problem (SOLVED!)

Before: You had TWO separate lists causing confusion:
- ❌ Bot had its own "watchlist" (hardcoded AAPL, MSFT, etc.)
- ❌ Platform had a separate "worklist"
- ❌ Had to retype symbols everywhere
- ❌ Scanner, Training, Backtest, Predictions all disconnected

## The Solution

**ONE unified WORKLIST** shared across EVERYTHING:
- ✅ Scanner results → WORKLIST
- ✅ AI Training uses WORKLIST
- ✅ Backtesting uses WORKLIST
- ✅ Predictions use WORKLIST
- ✅ Bot Trading monitors WORKLIST
- ✅ Manual trading uses WORKLIST

**Type symbols ONCE. Use EVERYWHERE.**

## 🎯 Your Trading Workflow (Warrior Trading Method)

### Step 1: Find Momentum Stocks (Scanner)

Your focus: **Small-cap momentum stocks** with Warrior Trading setups

```
1. Open Scanner window in platform
2. Set filters for momentum criteria:
   - Price: $1 - $20 (small cap range)
   - Volume: High relative volume (2x+)
   - Pattern: Bull flags, HOD breakouts, etc.
3. Run scan → Finds 50-100 candidates
4. Review results, filter best setups
```

### Step 2: Add to WORKLIST (One Click)

```
In Bot Trading tab:
1. Click "🔄 Add Scanner" button
2. All scanner symbols → WORKLIST
3. Done! Now you have 15-50 momentum stocks ready
```

**Your current WORKLIST has 15 symbols:**
- CLIK ($8.24)
- BMR ($2.04)

## 💡 Best Practices

### Building Your Worklist

**DO:**
- ✅ Use scanner to find momentum stocks
- ✅ Focus on small-cap ($1-$20)
- ✅ High relative volume (2x+)
- ✅ Warrior Trading patterns (bull flags, HOD breakouts)
- ✅ Keep 10-30 symbols max
- ✅ Update daily with fresh scanner results

**DON'T:**
- ❌ Add large-cap boring stocks (AAPL, MSFT)
- ❌ Add 100+ symbols (too many to manage)
- ❌ Keep dead stocks (remove losers)
- ❌ Forget to sync after scanning

### Training Workflow

```
Morning Routine:
1. 9:00 AM - Run scanner
2. 9:05 AM - Add hot stocks to worklist
3. 9:15 AM - Train AI on top 5 symbols
4. 9:30 AM - Market open, bot trading enabled
```

### Optimal Worklist Size

- **10-15 symbols:** Best for focused trading
- **15-30 symbols:** Good for diversification
- **30+ symbols:** Too many, hard to monitor

**Your current 15 is PERFECT!**
